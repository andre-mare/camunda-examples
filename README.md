# Camunda Examples
This repository contains a collection of Camunda BPM examples and guides, showcasing how to integrate and use Camunda 
with various technologies, including Spring Boot.


## Basic BPMN Element Examples 
The Basic BPMN Element Examples focus on demonstrating how to implement individual BPMN elements using Camunda with 
Spring Boot. 

Each example isolates a specific BPMN element (such as a task, gateway, or event) and provides a detailed walkthrough of 
how it is integrated within a Spring Boot application. These examples are designed to help developers understand the 
functionality of each BPMN element, while also showing how to configure and use Camundaâ€™s process engine to automate 
workflows with minimal setup.
