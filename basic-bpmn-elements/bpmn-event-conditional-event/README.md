# Guide: Implement a BPMN Conditional Event in Camunda with Spring Boot

In this guide, weâ€™ll walk you through implementing a BPMN Conditional Event in a Spring Boot application using Camunda. 
A Conditional Event allows you to trigger certain actions within a BPMN process based on the evaluation of a defined 
condition. This element is particularly useful when you want to wait for a specific situation or variable change to 
occur before continuing with the process. By the end of this guide, you'll have a working example that shows how 
Conditional Events can add flexibility and responsiveness to your workflows.

This tutorial is aimed at developers looking to enhance their process automation skills using Camunda BPM. If you're 
already familiar with setting up a Spring Boot application and integrating Camunda, this guide will help you further 
by implementing Conditional Events to trigger process flow based on dynamic conditions.
