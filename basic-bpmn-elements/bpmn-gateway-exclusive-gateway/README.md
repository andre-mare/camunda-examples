# Guide: Implement a BPMN Exclusive Gateway in Camunda with Spring Boot
In this guide, we’ll walk you through implementing a BPMN Exclusive Gateway in a Spring Boot application using Camunda.
An Exclusive Gateway is a key component in BPMN processes, allowing you to model decision points where only one path is
taken based on defined conditions. By the end of this guide, you’ll have a functional workflow that demonstrates how to
use Exclusive Gateways to direct the flow of your business processes based on specific rules.

This tutorial aims at developers who can automate decision-making within workflows using Camunda BPM. If you’re familiar
with setting up a Spring Boot application and integrating Camunda, this example will help you expand your understanding
by applying business logic with Exclusive Gateways.
