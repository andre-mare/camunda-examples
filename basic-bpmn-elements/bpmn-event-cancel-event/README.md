# Guide: Guide: Implement a BPMN Cancel Event in Camunda with Spring Boot

In this guide, we’ll walk you through implementing a BPMN Cancel Event in a Spring Boot application using Camunda. A 
Cancel Event is crucial in BPMN processes that involve transactions, allowing you to cancel an ongoing transaction and 
trigger alternative process flows when certain conditions are met. By the end of this guide, you’ll have a working 
example of how to use Cancel Events to manage and control transactional processes effectively in your workflows.

This tutorial is aimed at developers who are looking to handle complex transactional scenarios in Camunda BPM. If 
you’re already comfortable with Spring Boot and Camunda integration, this guide will help you build on that knowledge 
by introducing transaction management with BPMN Cancel Events.
